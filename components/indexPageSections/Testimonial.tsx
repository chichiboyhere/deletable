Thankfully, I got in touch with Dcommmando Security through a friend in Lagos. Through their vendor-sourcing outreach, they arranged an event planner for my uncle.

They stood guard at all entry/exit points all through the reception... To date my wife sings the praise of the four hefty men who bore her carriage as she made a royal entry to the hall. I've recommended them...ever since and THEY HAVEN'T FALLEN SHORT of expectations; not even once!",
